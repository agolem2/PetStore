If you use Java, please write a feature file in BDD style using Gherkin language. If you use Scala, ScalaTest is sufficient, you may use any testing style (e.g. FeatureSpec). 

 

Develop the automation framework for the above feature file / spec. 

 

In addition, provide documentation outlining setup and instructions to execute the framework as ReadMe.md Markdown file as part of your code. 

 

Please provide zip of source code and documentation or link to an online repository (e.g., GitHub) within 3-5 days.
